#Notice that we are using two FROM in the Dockerfile, we called it multi-stage builds.
#Multi-stage builds can help to optimize the docker image.
#We copy the built jar file from stage one which is maven and store only the jar file into the current working directory.
#Then, we discard the local Maven repositories and class files generated in the target directory.
